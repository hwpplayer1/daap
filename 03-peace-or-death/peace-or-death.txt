03 - Peace or Death

when I wake up every day
when I look into the mirror
I see a whole soul inside me
calling out my name

inviting me to peace of this holy war
war inside peace
peace inside war

whenever I walk in the dark
I see the bright light
whenever I walk in the sun
I see the dark side of the light

Now you broke the rules
to crack the perfect circle
The meaning of heaven
now calls you for peace or death

It is now the time
to get rid off the death
to be heaven with a whole soul 
inside another death
