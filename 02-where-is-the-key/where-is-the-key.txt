2 - where is the key ?

years passed by tears and lone way
in this cave
with crying
but I still hear a voice that calling me
calling for the truth
the true name of the love

And I'm still searching for the key
to unlock the door of a mysterius light

Now it is time to rise 
While the sun comes in the window

A warm welcome meets my eyes
And a sweet goodbye to last fear of my past life

It wasn't for nothing that the lone way
My God saved me My God called me 

Now It is time to rise
And call the truth of love 
To peace inside another war
For another way of life

To die happy within your arms
